## What's new

<!-- Describe this release's changes here, then publish the draft. Keep each paragraph on one line: release notes show line breaks as written. -->

## Downloads

- **Windows 10/11:** `Lithos-Launcher-Setup-{{VERSION}}.exe`
- **Ubuntu, Debian and relatives:** `Lithos-Launcher-{{VERSION}}.deb`, installed with `sudo apt install ./Lithos-Launcher-{{VERSION}}.deb`. Use this rather than the AppImage: it runs with Chromium's sandbox on and needs no extra packages.
- **Other Linux (x64):** `Lithos-Launcher-{{VERSION}}.AppImage`. It needs FUSE 2 (`libfuse2t64` on Ubuntu 24.04), and runs without Chromium's sandbox where the system blocks it.

## Unsigned builds

The builds aren't code-signed yet. On Windows, SmartScreen may show "Windows protected your PC": choose **More info → Run anyway**. Mark the AppImage executable before running it (`chmod +x`).

## Verify your download

- Linux: `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing`
- Windows (PowerShell): `Get-FileHash .\Lithos-Launcher-Setup-{{VERSION}}.exe`, and compare it with the line in SHA256SUMS

## Upgrading

Install over the previous version. The node, client, chain data and wallet live in `~/Lithos` (`C:\Users\<you>\Lithos` on Windows) and are kept. Uninstalling never removes them.

## Before mining for real

- Use a wallet made for mining, not your savings wallet, and keep its seed phrase on paper.
- Try **Test mining** first: it sends no transactions. A commitment locks your difficulty for 845 blocks.

## Requirements

64-bit Windows 10/11 or Linux, about 8 GB of RAM, tens of GB of disk for the chain, and a GPU miner that supports Autolykos 2.

## Problems?
